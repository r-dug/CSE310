            <h3>Introduction to Abstract Mathematics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Abstract mathematics focuses on operations within a set.</li>
                <li>A set exhibits <strong>closure</strong> if, when you perform an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on any two elements within the set, the result is also an element of the set.</li>
                <li>To show a set is <em>not</em> closed, you only need one counter example.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Real numbers are not closed under division because you cannot divide by zero.
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>Real Numbers / Division: NOT closed</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To demonstrate closure, an abstract construction that represents any arbitrary values is employed.

            <h3>Properties of Sets in Mathematics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>group</strong> has more properties added to sets that allow for powerful concepts in mathematics, specifically for the operations of addition and multiplication.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Definition of a Group (G):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An operation must be defined within the group.</li>
                        <li>Sets have closure under the operation.</li>
                        <li>Groups have an additive inverse for each element.</li>
                        <li>Groups have an additive identity element.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If <code>G</code> is a group under addition, then for any element <code>a</code> in <code>G</code>, the additive inverse is <code>-a</code> and the additive identity is <code>0</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inverses are unique to each element within the group and come in pairs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If any property fails, the group fails to be considered as such.

            <h3>Defining Addition and Multiplication in Groups</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Operations such as addition and multiplication can be abstractly defined and do not necessarily relate to standard arithmetic as we know it.</li>
                <li>For instance, in computing, binary addition follows the exclusive or (XOR) operation, while binary multiplication follows logical AND operations.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identity and Inverse in Groups:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Additive identity: Adding zero to any number returns the original number.</li>
                        <li>Additive inverse: Adding a number to its inverse (negative counterpart) returns the additive identity (zero).</li>
                        <li>Example for Real Numbers under addition: <code>3 + (-3) = 0</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Real numbers are a group under addition but not under multiplication due to the element zero lacking a multiplicative inverse.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Identification of Groups Using Real Numbers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Real numbers under addition is a group.</li>
                <li>Natural numbers under addition does not form a group due to lack of identity.</li>
                <li>Integers under addition do form a group.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>THIS WILL BE ON THE EXAM:</strong> Be able to demonstrate whether a set with a given operation is a group or not.
                </li>

            <h3>Exclusive Or and Logical AND Operations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Considering the set <code>{true, false}</code> which can also be represented as <code>{0, 1}</code>,
                    <ul>
                        <li>Addition defined as XOR forms a group.</li>
                        <li>Logical AND operation does not form a group because zero does not have an inverse.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Concept of Rings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A <strong>ring</strong> needs both addition and multiplication. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Set <code>R</code> is a group under addition.</li>
                        <li>Set <code>R</code> has an identity under multiplication.</li>
                        <li>Multiplication must distribute over addition.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A well-known ring is <code>GF(2)</code>, also known as Galois field, which corresponds to binary arithmetic used in computing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Upcoming Lectures:</strong> The next lecture will aim to prove that <code>GF(2)</code> is a ring.
